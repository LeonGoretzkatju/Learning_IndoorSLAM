### This is the project  used for plane segmentstion using the RANSAC based on the Open3d

This project is the baseline for the plane segmentation, the project still have many drawbacks, for example, It  is lack of the intelligence to select the real plane from the hole scene

If you want to use the project, you can compile it and run the command as follows:
./MeshPlaneDetection your path to the ply file

There are still so many work to do, I hope this work can  lay a solid foundation for the future.
